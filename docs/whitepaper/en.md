## Welcome to Walletika whitepaper
### Overview and what is our vision?
- Walletika is a decentralized crypto wallet app that provides the ability to manage digital assets through an app that focuses primarily on providing the highest level of protection, security and ease of use.

- We strive to be one of the leading projects in the crypto industry that contributes to the development of the digital financial system and makes it available worldwide to make financial transactions between people easier, faster and more secure, and to give everyone full freedom to retain and control their wealth without the need for a third party. This makes the world more stable in terms of the security of financial transactions.

- There is no doubt that the field of cryptocurrencies still faces some challenges and risks, but in fact this is the case for all systems in their beginnings and with time and continued development, these challenges will be eliminated, and that is why we are here and honored to be one of the companies that work and contribute to the development of this industry.

## The problems that Walletika seeks to solve
### Crypto users around the world face some problems as follows:
1- **Loss of Private Key** : The private key for a crypto wallet is one of the most important factors for protecting the digital assets it contains, and due to the impossibility of memorizing it mentally, many users resort to saving it in a text file on their own devices, which exposes them to theft or loss for various reasons.\
**Solution** : Walletika provides a unique solution that ensures no need to use the private key anymore and replace it with a decentralized login system that contains two passwords, and no transactions can be made without confirming the two-factor authentication code that changes every 30 seconds, as well as no private keys or passwords are stored anywhere to ensure the highest level of security.

2- **Risks of Third-Party Apps** : Crypto users are exposed to many attempts of theft through untrusted third-party apps, which makes beginners and even professionals may lose their money at any moment.\
**Solution** : Walletika app works as a closed unit by not interacting with third-party apps, which ensures not being exposed to such security threats.

3- **Multiple Blockchains** : In the world of crypto, there are many different blockchains and this leads to allocating a wallet app for each network, which makes users have to create multiple wallets, which leads to dispersion and increased pressure, especially in terms of securing many private keys.\
**Solution** : Walletika app provides multiple blockchains in one place, giving users greater ease in accessing a wide range of digital assets without having to create multiple wallets on different apps.

4- **Sending to The Wrong Address** : Many crypto users face the problem of sending to a wrong address due to the length of the address characters, which may make it difficult to notice any change or even replace the address due to malicious software.\
**Solution** : Walletika seeks to provide a system for registering wallet addresses names that links each wallet address with a custom name that is used in transactions instead of the wallet address directly, which avoids exposing the user to such a common problem.

5- **Death Cases** : Since only one person owns the private key for a crypto wallet, it would be disastrous when the wallet owner dies suddenly, as the family may lose their own fortune forever.\
**Solution** : Walletika seeks to provide a decentralized inheritance system dedicated for such cases, which ensures transferring money from the deceased's wallet to family wallets based on the plan set by the deceased before his death according to conditions that ensure secure execution of operations.

6- **Getting Cash** : Crypto users around the world face some difficulties in converting their cryptocurrencies into cash, especially in emergencies.\
**Solution** : Walletika seeks to provide a secure and decentralized system for buying and selling digital currencies for cash between people directly and also providing MasterCard credit cards that can be used through any ATM.

## Walletika's security and safety procedures
### The security and safety of our users is our top priority as follows:
1. Encrypting all application files with a default key that the user can change.
2. We do not store any sensitive data such as passwords or private keys on our servers or even on user devices, unlike other wallet applications that store private keys on user devices, which exposes them to the risk of data leakage in cases of hacking.
3. Each wallet has a username linked to two different passwords, and it can only be accessed if all the data is correct and accurate, which ensures no access even in cases of leaking part of the data such as the login password as it is commonly used.
4. Supporting decentralized two-factor authentication, which is a 6-digit code that changes every 30 seconds and requires confirmation to execute transactions.
5. The ability to install on an external storage unit (USB) that is not connected to the Internet to be away from hackers.
6. The application works as a closed unit by not interacting with third-party apps, which ensures not being exposed to deception and fraud operations.
7. The ability to backup all wallets to an encrypted external file that can be imported to ensure data security and easy recovery at any time.

The soft private sale has started since we start to building the project, which targets selling 500,000 WTK at $0.02 USD per token to raise $10,000 to fund small marketing and development operations.
> Note: All the people who invest in this stage will get 50% extra.

## Master private sale price plan
The master private sale will start in November 2023, which targets selling 4,500,000 WTK at $0.02 USD per token to raise $90,000 USD to fund big marketing and development operations that serve the pre-sale stage.

## Pre-sale price plan and start trading
The pre-sale will start in March 2024, which targets selling 35,000,000 WTK in 5 stages at an average price of $0.12 USD per token to raise an equivalent of $4,000,000 USD to pump dollar liquidity for centralized and decentralized exchanges against 13,000,000 WTK and start trading at a price of $0.30 USD.
> Note: We understand that some may see the period between the private sale and the pre-sale (4 months) relatively long, but according to our estimate, we need enough time to reach the largest number of users and investors to ensure the success of our operations and we hope you also understand that.
